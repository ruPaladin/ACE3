/*
 * Author: PabstMirror
 * Checks if object is a fence.  Should work on any fence type, even (typeof == "").
 * Call is fairly expensive because of all of the string checking.
 *
 * Arguments:
 * 0: An Object To Test <OBJECT>
 *
 * Return Value:
 * Is it a fence <BOOL>
 *
 * Example:
 * [aFence] call ace_logistics_wirecutter_fnc_isFence
 *
 * Public: No
